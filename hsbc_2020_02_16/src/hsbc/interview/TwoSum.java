/*
Since we are required to return the indicies, sorting is not a very good option

loop through array, use a dictionary(Hashmap) to record the previous integers and their indices

	key:  previous saw numbers
	value:  the indices for previous saw values

If target â€“ current_num in dictionary, then that means there is a previous value that adds current value to the required target.

The conner case we should check is if the input array is null or less than two elements.



run time: O(n), we are visiting each number exactly once.

Space complexity: O(n), we are storing every number and their indices.

where n is the number of integers in the array
